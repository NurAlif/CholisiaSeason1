We need GPU to train our neural network and also to process an image to get the result from the neural network.

Our project is an image detection program that has the main purpose to detect a person is being sick or not by providing a photo of the subject. This project is going to be funded by our university (State University of Yogyakarta). 

The length of the program for the project is approximately 5 months.

The zone is wherever it has GPU processing host capabilities but closest to Indonesia.
